Vegeta is a modern CSS Rewritten as SCSS format from framework based on [Bulma CSS framework](http://bulma.io). which is using SASS format

## CSS only
Like Bulma, Vegeta too is a **CSS** framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file.
There is **no** JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.

## Browser Support

Vegeta uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), Vegeta is compatible with:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer (10+)
* Opera
* Safari
